Data prediction Steps:-
- The training file is (pml-training.csv) is downloaded and preprocessed to omit the NA values.
- Unused columns such as user_name and raw_timestamp_part_1 are omitted.
- We formulated training and test sets by splitting the data into 80% for training and 20% for testing respectively.
- We performed random forest and decision tree algorithms.
- In the end, we found that random forest performed better than decision tree
- We built the confusion matrix as well for the same.
